# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

This is a continuation of the Shell, I began working with loops and conditionals in Bash.

## Summary
**For loop**

Syntax: ```for NAME [in LIST ]; do COMMANDS; done```

If [in LIST] is not present, it is replaced with in $@ and for executes the COMMANDS once for each positional parameter that is set.
NAME can be any variable name, although i is used very often. 
LIST can be any list of words, strings or numbers, which can be literal or generated by any command.
The COMMANDS to execute can also be any operating system commands, script, program or shell statement.
The return status is the exit status of the last command that executes. 
If no commands are executed because LIST does not expand to any items, the return status is zero.

Example:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# specific conversion script for my html files to php

# Assuming beginfile and endfile contain PHP code
beginfile="path/to/beginfile.php"
endfile="path/to/endfile.php"

for file in *.html; do
    new_name=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/html$/php/')
    
    # Copy contents of beginfile to new PHP file
    cat "$beginfile" > "$new_name"
    
    # Append manipulated HTML content to new PHP file
    sed -e '1,25d' "$file" | tac | sed -e '1,21d' | tac >> "$new_name"
    
    # Append contents of endfile to new PHP file
    cat "$endfile" >> "$new_name"
done
```
